        Welcome to TravelOMania, the world cultures trivia game! \n

        In this game, you will travel around to each continent, and answer trivia questions in the category
        of your choosing. The order that you play the continents is very important. There are seven continents,
        and they increase in difficulty as follows: The first 3 will have easy questions, continents 4 and 5 will have
        medium difficulty questions, and the 6th and 7th continents will consist of the most difficult questions. \n

        Each continent will have six categories to choose from for questions. The categories are: \n
        <b>Capitals</b> \n
        <b>Cuisines</b> \n
        <b>Festivals</b> \n
        <b>Landmarks</b> \n
        <b>Sports</b> \n
        <b>Politics</b> \n

        Within each category, you will have 7 multiple choice questions. If you answer 5 or more correctly,
        you will be able to move on to the next Continent! Otherwise, you may choose a different category
        and try again, with up to 3 attempts. With 3 failed categories, you will lose the game and will be
        required to start the game again from the beginning!
